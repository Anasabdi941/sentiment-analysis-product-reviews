## Course:
DSA 1080A — Data Science and Analytics

## Project Topic:
Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to classify Amazon product reviews into Positive, Negative or Neutral categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset:
Amazon Reviews Dataset (Kaggle)

## Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Files:
- **DSA1080_project.ipynb** — Main analysis and model-building notebook  
- **Amazon_Reviews.csv** — Dataset used  
- **Report.pdf** — Final project report  
- **README.md** — Documentation  

## Workflow Summary:
### Week 1 — Problem Definition & Data Collection  
### Week 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Cleaning  
### Week 3 — Feature Engineering  
### Week 4 — Model Training & Comparison  
### Week 5 — Evaluation & Final Reporting  

## Models Used:
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Linear SVM  
- Random Forest  

## Final Model:
**Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM)** achieved the highest F1-score (0.7445).

## Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

## Summary:
Linear SVM performed best overall, showing strong balance between precision and recall.  
The system successfully classifies customer sentiment and can support product review analysis in e-commerce.
